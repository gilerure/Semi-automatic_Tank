# Semi-automatic_Tank
A semi-automatic aiming and tracking tank built with Raspberry Pi and Yolov8.
The tank can judge enemies and allies based on one's posture, which can be divided into three categories including normal, defend and attack.
Moreover, it determines the distance and angle between itself and the detected object through facial position, assisting with mobility.
